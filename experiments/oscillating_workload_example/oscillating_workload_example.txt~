Lets observe the effect of oscillating workload on MDP and Khanna. We have six virtual machines; VM1, VM2, VM3, VM4 and VM5 have constant workload in all phases while VM6's workload oscillates. This experiment is carried out with low power cost. MDP is proactive and can see through oscillating workload and hence, chooses most profitable cycle, places VM6 on a separate PM which results in no migration.
Since Khanna is reactive to SLA violations, takes short-sighted migration decisions. VM6's workload is 0.1 in phase 1, 3, 5 and 7;  0.7 in phase 2,4,6 and 8.  Overutilizations and underutilization trigger migrations in even-numbered and odd-numbered phases respectively.
